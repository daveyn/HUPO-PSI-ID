### Minutes

--------------

#### 26th January 2021
##### Attendees
- Norman Davey
- Kim Van Roey
- Wim Vranken

##### Discussion points
- Updates on the MIADE 
- Updates on the PSI-ID formats
- Community announcment paper

##### Discussion Notes
- Add Sample to the XML and rearranging the data structure slightly. This will reduce improve the description of the data, redundancy and allow backwards compatability when conditionality is added.
- MIADE stays the same. But should though of as more like MIADR- - minimimun description of the structural state of a disordered regions inferred from a disorder experiment
- Define a simple abstract guideline for residue and region specific attributes in the attribute list.

##### Action points
- Read the MIADE guideline and comment
- Add Sample to the XML 
- Define Sample use cases and find issues
- Continue work on community announcment paper

--------------

#### 9th February 2021
##### Attendees
- Norman Davey
- Kim Van Roey

- Nico Palopoli
- Federica Quaglia

##### Discussion points
- Recap of the goals for Federica
- Continuation of how constructs should be defined 
- Incompatibilities between standard and DisProt
- Discussion of a experiment or region-centric standard

##### Discussion Notes
- Top down or bottom up construct definition
- *Top down* is define basic unit of interest and add features to define construct
- *Bottom up* is define construct - introduces the assumption that what is store is the real experimental construct
