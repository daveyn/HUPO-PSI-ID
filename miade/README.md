# MIADE GUIDELINES
## Minimum Information About Disorder Experiments (

### The goals of MIADE are:

The MIADE guidelines define the minimum level of information that is required to comprehend the results of the experimental investigation of an IDR. As such, MIADE-compliant entries fall far short of the annotation of an IDR experiment to a level of detail that allows the experiment to be fully reproduced. However, the guidelines are a compromise between the excessive burden of the full annotation of an experiment and the capture of the most important information to clearly describe the key result of the experiment. Data annotated to this minimum common standard permits unambiguous definition of experimental results, the deposition of the data into resources and the interchange of data between resources.
