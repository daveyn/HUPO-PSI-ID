# HUPO-PSI-ID
#### Formats and standards for the HUPO-PSI intrinsically disordered proteins community


##### The goals of the community are:

* define the community data formats and associated controlled vocabularies to permit the dissemination and storage of relating to IDR structure and function.
* define the Minimum Information About Disorder Experiments (MIADE) guidelines to standardise the description of IDP experiments.
* support the integration of the developed standards into IDP tools and resources
* define the rules and guidelines for the curation of IDP literature and annotation of IDP data

The main projects supported by the group are the definition and development of the MIADE guidelines, PSI-ID XML format, PSI-ID TAB format and PSI-ID controlled vocabulary.
