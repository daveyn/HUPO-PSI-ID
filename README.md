# HUPO-PSI-IDP
## Formats and standards for the HUPO-PSI intrinsically disordered proteins community


### We're looking for community input:
Document for community input on XML schema [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rfB3FiM6vSIGw3bQtQZdZeVhF-_fvTXMOu8UqdNfXdY/edit?usp=sharing)

An XSD of HUPO-PSI-IDP XML format is available [here](./formats/xml/draft_v4/PSI-ID_schema-v4.xsd)

An example of the HUPO-PSI-IDP v4 XML format holding a IDR annotation is available [here](./formats/xml/draft_v4/instance-v4-pmid_27515574.xml)


Document for community input on MIADE guideline [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SK7UvZrpg6KQkkXpcN90Pipqhyc_DdoUNHTWxnX0H-M/)

### The goals of the community are:
The PSI-IDP working group is composed of academic, government, and industry researchers, software developers and database curators and managers. The main goals of the PSI-IDP working group are to:
* define the community PSI-IDP XML exchange format and associated controlled vocabularies to permit the dissemination and storage of data relating to IDR structure and function.
* define the Minimum Information About Disorder Experiments (MIADE) guidelines to standardise the description of intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) experiments.
* support the integration of the developed standards, exchange formats and controlled vocabularies into IDP tools and resources.
* define the rules and guidelines for the curation of IDP literature and the annotation of IDP data.

Current projects of the PSI-IDP working group are:
* definition and development of the MIADE guidelines.
* definition and development of the PSI-ID XML format and the PSI-IDP TAB format, working together with the PSI-MI workgroup.
* development of the PSI-IDP controlled vocabulary.

### The slides on current plans/progress:

### Milestones:
**Milestone 1** Submission of a manuscript to a journal in the field to announce the PSI-IDP WG

**Goal 1:** Completion of the MIADE standard defining the minimal fundamental parameters to describe a structural disorder experiment, based on simple use cases

**Goal 2:** Completion of the 1.0 version of the PSI-IDP TAB format to represent, in a simple but unambiguous manner, an entry adhering to the MIADE guidelines for the description of the structural state of a protein region

**Goal 3:** Completion of the 1.0 version of the PSI-IDP XML format to allow the experimental setup and results of an analysis of the structure state of a protein region to be unequivocally represented

**Milestone 2:** Setting up the WG website/GitHub page to serve as a platform for dissemination of developed formats and standards

**Goal 4:** Work together with the PSI-MI WG to set up a protocol for integrating IDP interaction data into core data resources of molecular interactions

**Goal 5:** Defining the scope and priorities for version 1.0 of the CV for IDPs

### HUPO-PSI guidelines and standards:
Thsis directory contains describing HUPO-PSI guidelines and standards. **All documents are in draft form** and have not been submitted by the HUPO-PSI review process. We are happy to have new contriibutors to the project.
